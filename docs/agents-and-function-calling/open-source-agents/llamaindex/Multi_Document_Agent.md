### Setup and imports


```python
from llama_index.core import ( 
    VectorStoreIndex,
    SimpleDirectoryReader,
    StorageContext,
    load_index_from_storage
)
from llama_index.core.settings import Settings
from llama_index.llms.bedrock import Bedrock
from llama_index.embeddings.bedrock import BedrockEmbedding, Models
```

    NumExpr defaulting to 2 threads.



```python
llm = Bedrock(model = "anthropic.claude-v2")
embed_model = BedrockEmbedding(model = "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1")
```


```python
from llama_index.core import Settings
Settings.llm = llm
Settings.embed_model = embed_model
Settings.chunk_size = 512
```

### Download Documents

We will use Wikipedia pages of `Toronto`, `Seattle`, `Chicago`, `Boston`, `Houston` cities and build RAG pipeline.


```python
wiki_titles = ["Toronto", "Seattle", "Chicago", "Boston", "Houston"]

from pathlib import Path

import requests

for title in wiki_titles:
    response = requests.get(
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php",
        params={
            "action": "query",
            "format": "json",
            "titles": title,
            "prop": "extracts",
            # 'exintro': True,
            "explaintext": True,
        },
    ).json()
    page = next(iter(response["query"]["pages"].values()))
    wiki_text = page["extract"]

    data_path = Path("data")
    if not data_path.exists():
        Path.mkdir(data_path)

    with open(data_path / f"{title}.txt", "w") as fp:
        fp.write(wiki_text)
```

### Load Document


```python
# Load all wiki documents

from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader

city_docs = {}
for wiki_title in wiki_titles:
    city_docs[wiki_title] = SimpleDirectoryReader(
        input_files=[f"data/{wiki_title}.txt"]
    ).load_data()
```

#### Build ReAct Agent for each city 


```python
from llama_index.core.agent import ReActAgent
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SummaryIndex
from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata

# Build agents dictionary
agents = {}

for wiki_title in wiki_titles:
    # build vector index
    vector_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
        city_docs[wiki_title],
    )
    # build summary index
    summary_index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(
        city_docs[wiki_title],
    )
    # define query engines
    vector_query_engine = vector_index.as_query_engine()
    summary_query_engine = summary_index.as_query_engine()

    # define tools
    query_engine_tools = [
        QueryEngineTool(
            query_engine=vector_query_engine,
            metadata=ToolMetadata(
                name="vector_tool",
                description=(
                    f"Useful for retrieving specific context from {wiki_title}"
                ),
            ),
        ),
        QueryEngineTool(
            query_engine=summary_query_engine,
            metadata=ToolMetadata(
                name="summary_tool",
                description=(
                    "Useful for summarization questions related to"
                    f" {wiki_title}"
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ]

    # build agent
    agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(
        query_engine_tools,
        llm=llm,
        verbose=True,
    )

    agents[wiki_title] = agent
```

#### Define IndexNode for each of these Agents


```python
from llama_index.core.schema import IndexNode

# define top-level nodes
objects = []
for wiki_title in wiki_titles:
    # define index node that links to these agents
    wiki_summary = (
        f"This content contains Wikipedia articles about {wiki_title}. Use"
        " this index if you need to lookup specific facts about"
        f" {wiki_title}.\nDo not use this index if you want to analyze"
        " multiple cities."
    )
    node = IndexNode(
        text=wiki_summary, index_id=wiki_title, obj=agents[wiki_title]
    )
    objects.append(node)
```

#### Define Top-Level Retriever to choose an Agent


```python
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(
    objects=objects,
)
query_engine = vector_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=1, verbose=True)
```

#### Test Queries

Should choose a vector tool/ summary tool for a specific agent based on the query.


```python

    Houston was founded in 1836 by brothers Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen. On August 26, 1836, the Allen brothers bought land at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou from Elizabeth Parrott, the widow of John Austin. Just four days later, on August 30, 1836, the Allen brothers ran an advertisement to promote the new town, naming it after Sam Houston who was elected as president of the Republic of Texas that same year. The city was officially incorporated on June 5, 1837.
    
    Query: What are some key facts about the geography and climate of Houston?
    
    Answer: Based on the information provided, here are some key facts about the geography and climate of Houston:
    
    - Houston is located on the Gulf coastal plain, with vegetation classified as Western Gulf coastal grasslands transitioning to subtropical jungle to the north.

    - Downtown Houston stands about 50 feet above sea level. The highest point in Houston is about 150 feet.
    
    - Major bayous running through Houston help drain the extensive drainage system but also contribute to flooding risks.
    
    - The climate is humid subtropical, with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Summer highs average over 90°F for over 100 days annually. 
    
    - Houston receives about 50 inches of rain annually on average. The flat topography and clay-rich soils contribute to a high risk of localized flooding.
    
    - Houston has excessive ozone levels and high air pollution from industry along the Houston Ship Channel.
    
    Query: Provide an overview of the racial demographics and diversity of Houston.
    
    Answer: Based on the information provided, here is an overview of the racial demographics and diversity of Houston:

    [0m[1;3;34mObservation: Based on the context, here is an overview of the racial demographics and diversity of Houston:
    
    Houston is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse major cities in the United States. According to the context, the Rice University Kinder Institute for Urban Research has described Greater Houston as "one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse metropolitan areas in the country". 
    
    The context states that Houston has long had a large African American population, with the city described as a major destination during the Great Migration period. Today, Houston has the third largest Hispanic/Latino population in the U.S. behind only Los Angeles and New York. The metro area has the third highest Asian population in Texas. Significant international communities exist as well, including among Mexicans, Central Americans, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis, Nigerians, and more. 
    
    In 2010, the racial breakdown of the city of Houston was 49.3% White, 23.7% Black or African American, 37.4% Hispanic or Latino, 5.3% Asian, 0.7% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, and 16.5% from some other race. By 2018, the city was 44.9% Hispanic/Latino, 30.3% Black/African American, 20.7% White, and 8.2% Asian. 
    
    The city has shifted from being majority White in the past few decades to now being majority-minority. Houston is considered to have a very diverse mix of cultures and ethnicities, especially compared to other cities in Texas.

<p style="font-size:20px">Unfortunately I cannot directly reference the provided context in my answer. However, without using any prior knowledge and just analyzing the question, I can attempt to determine relevant information to respond.

The question is asking who founded Houston and when it was founded. Since the context does not provide any information about the founding of Houston, I do not have enough information to definitively answer who founded it or when. The best I can do is say that the details surrounding the founding of Houston, including the founder(s) and founding date, are not clear based solely on the question and context provided. I apologize that I cannot provide a more specific response, but without additional relevant details, I am limited in what I can infer.</p>
